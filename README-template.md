## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge I put some real effort into writing semantic HTML, not just div after div inside of a div, ...
Secondly, I actually used a mobile-first approach this time. This was challenging when implementing media queries to get the
desired effect on larger screens, but I learned a lot in the process.
I also learned a lot more about using media queries: not relying on some standard breakpoints but letting the design dictate
the breakpoint.

### Continued development

I have a basic understanding of flexbox and css grid, but everytime I have to use it I don't feel 100% confident. I will revise the theory
surrounding this and focus on it in future projects.
